                  We collect and use personal information only to the extent
                  permitted by law, particularly the <em>Privacy Act 1988 </em>

                <p>
                  Information which cannot be reasonably linked to your identity
                  (e.g. IP address, browser information, favourite websites or

                  information and is not regulated by the{" "}
                  <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The personal information that we collect is primarily related
                  to our services. The personal information collected may vary
                  depending on your particular interaction with Trademarkable
                  but will be limited to the information necessary to record and
                  manage our interaction with you or as permitted or required by
                  law.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By providing personal information and/or continuing to engage

                  Trademarkable’s servers save this information for security
                  purposes.&nbsp; We may also evaluate anonymous or
                  de-identified data sets for statistical purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will only collect personal information that you provide us
                  and you are entirely free to decide whether or not to supply
                  this information. However, you acknowledge and agree that if
                  you do not provide sufficient or adequate information to us,
                  we may not be able to provide you with our full range of
                  services and may not be able to fully assist you with your
                  enquiry.

                  collected which may include:

                <h4>3. Disclosure and Use of Personal Information</h4>

                  To the extent permissible by law, the personal information
                  that you provide to us will be kept confidential at all times.
                  However, in providing you with our services, we may be
                  required to disclose personal information to certain third
                  parties which may include:
                </p>
                <p>– governmental offices (such as IP Australia);</p>

                    – a Court (such as the Federal Court of Australia);
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    – other persons (such as agents and associates in foreign
                    countries).
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We do not disclose personal information for the purpose of
                  third party direct marketing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We only disclose personal information to third parties (such
                  as agents and associates in foreign countries) in
                  circumstances where you expressly instruct us to do so or as
                  may be required by law.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, notwithstanding the above, you acknowledge that by
                  providing us with your personal information, you agree to the
                  disclosure of your personal information to third parties
                  operating outside of Australia. You acknowledge and agree that
                  we will not be liable to you for any breach of the Privacy Act
                  by these overseas third parties on the basis that you consent
                  to such disclosure.

                <h4>5. Security</h4>
                <p>
