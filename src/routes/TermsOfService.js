                <h4>3. Scope of Services</h4>
                <p>
                  3.1 The Services purchased through the Trademarkable Website
                  relates to:
                </p>
                <p>
                  (a) the filing of a trade mark application to IP Australia,
                  and optionally:
                </p>
                <p>

                  (ii) requesting expedited examination of the trade mark
                  application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3.2 Following the filing of a trade mark application to IP
                  Australia, Your trade mark application will be examined by IP
                  Australia to determine if Your trade mark meets the
                  legislative requirements for registrability. Examination
                  typically commences 4-6 months after the filing of a trade
                  mark application. If there are any issues raised during the
                  examination of Your trade mark application, an adverse
                  examination report will issue from IP Australia. We will
                  forward, without cost, the adverse examination report to You
                  with brief comments together with a fixed fee quote for Us to
                  prepare and file a response to the adverse examination report.
                  We will only proceed to prepare and file a response to the
                  adverse examination report after We receive Your instructions
                  to do so and after We receive full payment of the fee quote.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3.3 You should be aware that We cannot guarantee the
                  registration of Your trade mark. The registrability of Your
                  trade mark will depend on a number of factors considered
                  during examination including, but not limited to, the
                  similarity of Your trade mark to other existing pending or
                  registered Australian trade marks, the capability of Your
                  trade mark to distinguish, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3.4 If You purchase the Service Item relating to requesting
                  expedited examination, We will submit a request to IP
                  Australia to expedite examination of Your trade mark
                  application. If expedited examination is requested,
                  examination typically commences within 2 to 4 weeks after
                  expedited examination is requested at IP Australia. How
                  quickly Your trade mark application is examined will depend on
                  a number of factors including, for example, the current
                  workload of IP Australia. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee
                  that Your trade mark application will be expedited or that
                  examination will commence within 2 to 4 weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3.5 For any work that is outside of Our Services relating to
                  the filing of Your trade mark application (clause 3.1) or
                  during examination (clause 3.2), We will provide You with a
                  fixed fee quote and seek Your instructions.

                  applicable Law, in force from time to time, in Your relevant

                <p>
                  5.1 The Trademarkable website will contain instructions, which
                  will guide You through the process of placing an order for
                  Service Items. You will be offered the opportunity to review
                  Your proposed order and to confirm or correct it prior to
                  finally placing Your order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5.2 You acknowledge and agree that, unless required by law,
                  Service Items purchased through the Trademarkable website
                  cannot be amended or cancelled once You have placed Your
                  order, so please review Your order carefully before placing
                  it. Once You have finalised payment, You will receive an
                  electronic acknowledgement providing You with a receipt. If
                  You do not receive an electronic acknowledgement from Us
                  within 24 to 48 hours after You processed the order, please
                  contact Us at{" "}

                  , as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5.3 Unless We have notified You otherwise, the acceptance of
                  Your order will take place once payment has been debited to
                  Your credit or debit card with respect to the relevant Service
                  Item ordered by You.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5.4 You acknowledge and agree that We will not accept Your
                  order if We:
                </p>
                <p>(a) are unable to obtain authorisation for Your payment;</p>
                <p>
                  (b) suspect fraudulent activity or violation of these Terms of
                  Service or Our Privacy Policy; or
                </p>
                <p>(c) identify a Service Item or pricing error.</p>
                <p>
                  5.5 If We are unable to provide You with the Service Item you
                  have requested following electronic acknowledgement, We will
                  contact You by email advising You of this.

                <p>
                  5.6 If You require any information regarding your order(s),
                  please contact Us at{" "}

                <p>
                  5.7 By purchasing Our Services through the Trademarkable
                  Website, You confirm that the credit or debit card that is
                  being used is owned by You.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5.8 You acknowledge and agree that all credit and debit
                  cardholders are subject to validation checks and authorisation
                  by the card issuer. If the issuer of Your payment card refuses
                  to or does not, for any reason, authorise payment to Us,
                  whether in advance or subsequent to a payment, We will not be
                  liable for any delay or non-delivery of Our Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5.9 Your Credit Card Verification (CCV) number will be
                  requested during the processing of your payment online. This
                  number is only found on the physical card, not on any receipts
                  or imprints from EFTPOS machines. Although this does not
                  guarantee that the card used for the purchase has not been
                  stolen, it does assure Us that the person placing the order
                  has the card physically with them at the time of the order,
                  and is therefore an additional security measure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5.10 If We reasonably believe, in Our sole discretion, that
                  the completion of Your order may result in a violation of
                  these Terms of Service or Our Privacy Policy, We may, with or
                  without notice, cancel or modify Your request for Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5.11 You acknowledge and agree that, from time to time, orders
                  or parts of an order may be cancelled by Us for various
                  reasons, including that:
                </p>
                <p>(a) We are no longer able to provide Our Service;</p>
                <p>
                  (b) there was difficulty in processing payment information;
                </p>
                <p>
                  (c) delivery to the email address was not possible; and/or
                </p>
                <p>(d) a duplicate order was placed.</p>
                <p>
                  5.12 If Your order is cancelled, the appropriate amount less
                  any reasonable costs incurred for Services already provided by
                  Us will be refunded to You via Your original payment method.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5.13 Unless otherwise stated, all prices are quoted in and
                  payable in Australian Dollars and are inclusive of GST (where
                  applicable).
                </p>
                <p>
                  5.14 We reserve the right to amend the prices for Service
                  Items at any time without prior notice to You. You will be
                  informed of the applicable prices for the relevant Service
                  Items as You proceed through the order process.

                <p>
                  7.2 Your continued use of Our Services will represent an

                  amended.
                </p>
                <h4>8. No Reliance</h4>
                <p>
                  8.1 To the fullest extent permitted by law, We do not
                  represent or warrant:
                </p>
                <p>
                  (a) the suitability of Our Services for Your intended use; or

                  11.1 You represent and warrant to Us on a continuing basis
                  that:
                </p>

                <p>
                  (d) Your use of the Trademarkable Website in accordance with

                  arising under contract, common law or statute;

                <p>
                  (e) You are under no obligation whatsoever to any third party

                <p>

                  availability and functionality of the Trademarkable Website
                  and Your ability to access and use the Trademarkable Website,
                  may depend on factors and circumstances beyond Our control
                  including telecommunications network issues (such as network
                  capacity restrictions, physical and environmental conditions,
                  technical constraints and Network Operator issues), Service
                  Provider issues and factors that prevent intended recipients
                  from receiving alerts and other communications (for example,
                  Service Provider and account issues). We cannot therefore
                  claim or guarantee that the Trademarkable Website will be
                  available to You at all times or be free from faults or
                  interruptions.
                </p>
                <p>11.4 You acknowledge and agree that:</p>

                  any damage to Your computer system or for loss of data that
                  results from any such download;
                </p>
                <p>
                  (b) no advice or information, whether oral or written,
                  obtained by You from Us or through the Trademarkable Website
                  will create any warranty not expressly included in these Terms
                  of Service or required by law; and
                </p>
                <p>
                  (c) the Trademarkable Website is provided on an ‘as is’ and
                  ‘as available’ basis. Except for any Non-excludable Guarantee
                  (as defined in clause 14.7 below), We and Our Service
                  Providers exclude all terms, conditions, warranties and
                  guarantees implied by custom, course of dealing, the general
                  law or statute whatsoever.

                <p>
                  11.5 Without in any way limiting the above, You expressly
                  acknowledge and agree that We and Our Service Providers make

                </p>
                <p>
                  (a) the Trademarkable Website will meet Your requirements, or
                  will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free;
                </p>
                <p>
                  (b) the information obtained from Your use of the
                  Trademarkable Website will be complete, accurate or reliable;

                  through the Trademarkable Website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  11.7 Any condition, warranty or guarantee that legislation
                  applies to the supply of Our Services to You or the provision
                  of the Trademarkable Website under these Terms of Service is
                  taken to be included in these Terms of Service, if that
                  legislation renders void or prohibits contractual provisions
                  which:

                <p>(a) exclude, restrict or modify; or</p>
                <p>
                  (b) which have the effect of excluding, restricting or

                  by, or any liability under, such condition, warranty or

                </p>
                <p>
                  11.8 To the maximum extent permitted by law, We limit Our
                  liability for any breach of any Non-excludable Guarantee to
                  the:
                </p>
                <p>
                  (a) refund of the monetary amount You paid for the relevant
                  Service Item; or
                </p>
                <p>(b) resupply of the relevant Service Item.</p>
                <p>
                  11.9 You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent
                  permitted by law:
                </p>
                <p>
                  (a) We and each of Our Service Providers, exclude all

                  unenforceable or illegal for any reason, it is to be read down
                  to give it as much effect as possible, or if it is not capable
